<p>These Terms of Service (the &quot;Agreement&quot;) explain the terms and conditions by which you may access and use the Products provided by Kalijo Inc. (referred to herein as &quot;Kalijo Inc&quot;,  “Kalijo”, &quot;we&quot;, &quot;our&quot;, or &quot;us&quot;).  The Products shall include, but shall not necessarily be limited to, (a)  https://www.kalijo.io,, a website-hosted user interface (the &quot;Interface&quot; or &quot;App&quot;), (b) an aggregator of various third-party non-fungible token (&quot;NFT&quot;) marketplaces (the &quot;NFT Marketplace Aggregator&quot;) and (‎c) our mobile wallet application (the &quot;Kalijo Wallet&quot;). You must read this Agreement carefully as it governs your use of the Products. By accessing or using any of the Products, you signify that you have read, understand, and agree to be bound by this Agreement in its entirety. If you do not agree, you are not authorized to access or use any of our Products and should not use our Products.</p>
<p>To access or use any of our Products, you must be able to form a legally binding contract with us. Accordingly, you represent that you are at least the age of majority in your jurisdiction and have the full right, power, and authority to enter into and comply with the terms and conditions of this Agreement on behalf of yourself and any company or legal entity for which you may access or use the Interface.  If you are entering into this Agreement on behalf of an entity, you represent to us that you have the legal authority to bind such entity.</p>
<p>You further represent that you are not (a) the subject of economic or trade sanctions administered or enforced by any governmental authority or otherwise designated on any list of prohibited or restricted parties (including but not limited to the list maintained by the Office of Foreign Assets Control of the U.S. Department of the Treasury) or (b) a citizen, resident, or organized in a jurisdiction or territory that is the subject of comprehensive country-wide, territory-wide, or regional economic sanctions by the United States. Finally, you represent that your access and use of any of our Products will fully comply with all applicable laws and regulations, and that you will not access or use any of our Products to conduct, promote, or otherwise facilitate any illegal activity.</p>
<p>NOTICE:</p>
<p>This Agreement contains important information, including a binding arbitration provision and a class action waiver, both of which impact your rights as to how disputes are resolved. Our Products are only available to you — and you should only access any of our Products — if you agree completely with these terms.</p>

        <span>1.1 The Interface</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>The Interface provides a web or mobile-based means of access to (a) a decentralized protocol on various public blockchains, including but not limited to Zilliqa, that allows users to trade certain compatible digital assets (the &quot;Kalijo protocol&quot; or the &quot;Protocol&quot;); and (b) the NFT Marketplace Aggregator.</p>
<p>The Interface is distinct from the Protocol and is one, but not the exclusive, means of accessing the Protocol. The Protocol itself comprises open-source or source-available self-executing smart contracts that are deployed on various public blockchains, such as Zilliqa. Kalijo Inc does not control or operate any version of the Protocol on any blockchain network. By using the Interface, you understand that you are not buying or selling digital assets from us and that we do not operate any liquidity pools on the Protocol or control trade execution on the Protocol. When traders pay fees for trades, those fees accrue to liquidity providers for the Protocol. As a general matter, Kalijo Inc is not a liquidity provider into Protocol liquidity pools and liquidity providers are independent third parties. The Protocol was initially deployed on the Zilliqa blockchain.. Deployments on other networks typically make use of cross-chain bridges, which allow assets native to one blockchain to be transferred to another blockchain. Please note that digital assets that have been &quot;bridged&quot; or &quot;wrapped&quot; to operate on other blockchain networks (including to blockchains compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine that are designed to ensure the Ethereum blockchain can effectively process more transactions or other blockchains that are frequently referred to as &quot;Layer 2&quot; solutions) are distinct from the original Zilliqa mainnet asset.</p>
<p>To access the Interface, you must use a non-custodial wallet software, which allows you to interact with public blockchains. Your relationship with that non-custodial wallet provider is governed by the applicable terms of service (with respect to the Kalijo Wallet, this Agreement, and with respect to a third party wallet, the applicable terms of service of such third party).  We do not have custody or control over the contents of your wallet and have no ability to retrieve or transfer its contents. By connecting your wallet to our Interface, you agree to be bound by this Agreement and all of the terms incorporated herein by reference.</p>

        <span>1.2 The NFT Marketplace Aggregator</span>
    </h3>
</doc-anchor-target>
<p>The NFT Marketplace Aggregator is a series of smart contracts that allows you to discover, buy, and sell NFTs simultaneously across multiple third-party marketplaces (each a &quot;Third-Party Marketplace&quot;).</p>
<p>The NFT Marketplace Aggregator enables transactions involving NFTs that are listed on Third-Party Marketplaces. The listing information and pricing for NFTs is determined by the corresponding Third-Party Marketplace on which the NFT is listed. Kalijo Inc does not determine what to list or set pricing for NFTs on those Third-Party Marketplaces.</p>
<p>The NFT Marketplace Aggregator may include functionality designed to enable the purchase of all or substantially all of the NFTs in a particular collection (a &quot;Sweep&quot;). By executing a Sweep, we will promptly execute a batched smart contract-based transaction on your behalf to purchase the NFTs that are part of the Sweep. In the event one or more NFTs are not available at the time we execute the purchase transaction with the corresponding Third-Party Marketplace, we will refund to your wallet the pro-rata portion of the purchase price for any NFTs that were unavailable, less any Gas Fees. You agree and acknowledge that Kalijo Inc does not guarantee that a Sweep will be successful in acquiring all of the NFTs in a particular collection or that you will achieve any particular financial result or outcome or otherwise obtain any particular economic benefit by executing a Sweep.</p>
<p>NFTs available for purchase through the NFT Marketplace Aggregator may contain smart-contract terms that specify certain royalties which are payable to the original creator or another individual in connection with a subsequent sale of the NFT (a &quot;Transaction Royalty&quot;). The NFT Marketplace Aggregator does not impose any additional Transaction Royalties on NFT transactions. However, the NFT Marketplace Aggregator will pass-through any Transaction Royalties to the extent imposed by the underlying Third-Party Marketplace on which the digital asset is originally listed for sale.</p>

<p>The NFT Marketplace Aggregator merely aggregates the results from Third-Party Marketplaces. These Third-Party Marketplaces are operated independently from us by unrelated third parties, and we have no control over any content, information or other materials contained within such Third-Party Marketplaces. If you believe that your copyrighted work is being displayed on a Third-Party Marketplace, has been copied in a way that constitutes copyright infringement, or that your intellectual property rights have been otherwise violated, you should notify that Third-Party Marketplace of your infringement claim in accordance with their defined reporting procedures.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite our position as an aggregator, Kalijo Inc will process and investigate notices of alleged infringement and will take appropriate actions under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (&quot;DMCA&quot;) and other applicable intellectual property laws with respect to any alleged or actual infringement on the NFT Marketplace Aggregator. A notification of claimed copyright infringement should be submitted to the Kalijo email address: support@kalijo.io</p>
<p>We encourage you to use the above email to ensure the requisite information is included in your notice. Your notice must include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identification of the copyrighted work(s), trademark, publicity rights, or other intellectual property rights that you claim is being infringed;</li>
<li>Identification of the allegedly infringing material that is requested to be removed, including a description of the specific location (i.e., urls) on the Interface of the material claimed to be infringing, so that we may locate the material;</li>
<li>Your contact information -- including your full legal name and email address;</li>
<li>A declaration that contains all of the following:</li>
<li>A statement that you have a good faith belief that use of the material in the manner complained of is not authorized by the intellectual property rights owner, its agent, or the law;</li>
<li>A statement that the information in the notice is accurate;</li>
<li>A statement under penalty of perjury that you are authorized to act on behalf of the intellectual property owner of the intellectual property that is allegedly being infringed.</li>
<li>Your physical or electronic signature.
If you believe that your content that was removed (or to which access was disabled) is not infringing, or that you have the authorization from the copyright owner, the copyright owner&#x27;s agent, or pursuant to the law, to upload and use the removed content, you may submit a written counter-notice to us or our Copyright Agent.</li>

Such websites may include additional terms governing the use of the NFT that owners of the NFT will be required to comply with. We are not a party to any such intrinsic NFT terms, which are between creators, sellers, and buyers. The buyer and seller are entirely responsible for communicating, promulgating, agreeing to, and enforcing those terms, and you are solely responsible for reviewing such terms.</p>

<p>IN PARTICULAR, YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THE MARKETS FOR THESE DIGITAL ASSETS ARE NASCENT AND HIGHLY VOLATILE DUE TO RISK FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ADOPTION, SPECULATION, TECHNOLOGY, SECURITY, AND REGULATION. YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ANYONE CAN CREATE A TOKEN, INCLUDING FAKE VERSIONS OF EXISTING TOKENS AND TOKENS THAT FALSELY CLAIM TO REPRESENT PROJECTS, AND ACKNOWLEDGE AND ACCEPT THE RISK THAT YOU MAY MISTAKENLY TRADE THOSE OR OTHER TOKENS.

</doc-anchor-target>
<p>We will use our best efforts to resolve any potential disputes through informal, good faith negotiations. If a potential dispute arises, you must contact us by sending an email to support@kalijo.io so that we can attempt to resolve it without resorting to formal dispute resolution. If we aren&#x27;t able to reach an informal resolution within sixty days of your email, then you and we both agree to resolve the potential dispute according to the process set forth below.
Any claim or controversy arising out of or relating to any of our Products, this Agreement, or any other acts or omissions for which you may contend that we are liable, including, but not limited to, any claim or controversy as to arbitrability (&quot;Dispute&quot;), shall be finally and exclusively settled by arbitration under the JAMS Optional Expedited Arbitration Procedures. You understand that you are required to resolve all Disputes by binding arbitration. The arbitration shall be held on a confidential basis before a single arbitrator, who shall be selected pursuant to JAMS rules. The arbitration will be held in Palau unless you and we both agree to hold it elsewhere. Unless we agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate your claims with those of any other party. Any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. If for any reason a claim by law or equity must proceed in court rather than in arbitration you agree to waive any right to a jury trial and any claim may be brought only in a Palau Court.</p>
